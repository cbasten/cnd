NAME
    CNDm - Calculate Cytonuclear disequilibrium for multi-allelic systems

SYNOPSIS
    CNDm [ -i *data input* ] [ -o *data output* ] [ -e *log file* ] [ -t ] [
    -V ] [ -X ] ...

DESCRIPTION
    CNDm calculates cytonuclear disequilibria for multi-allelic systems.

OPTIONS
    -o  Use this to specify the data output file. CNDm will append to a file
        that already exists. The default value is CNDm.out.

    -i  You need to specify a data input file with this option. The default
        value is CNDm.dat. See the example files for the format.

    -e  This allows you to name a log file. The default value is CNDm.err.

    -t  Using this flag flips a switch to output data analysis in LaTeX2e
        format.

    -X  This flag flips a switch to stop the calculation of exact test
        p-values. It is a way to run a quick analysis.

    -V  This is a switch to turn off a bunch of diagnostic messages. The
        program will run quietly. It is useful for running CNDm as a
        background job.

    -r  This option requires a positive integer and sets the number of
        repetitions (R) in both the Monte Carlo and Markov chain analyses.
        If none of the other options are set, then the B parameters will be
        set to 10 and the C parameters to R/10. It is preferable to use the
        -rB and -rC options directly. It is zero by default, which means
        that neither Monte Carlo nor Markov Chain analyses will be
        performed.

    -rB This requires a positive integer and sets the number of batches of
        repetitions for both Monte Carlo and Markov Chain analyses. The
        total number of repetitions is split into batches to estimate
        sampling variances.

    -rC This requires a positive integer and sets the number of repetitions
        within a batch for both Monte Carlo and Markov Chain analyses.

    -m  This requires a positive integer and sets the number of batches of
        repetitions for the Markov Chain analysis.

    -mB This sets the number of batches of repetitions forthe Markov Chain
        analysis.

    -mC This requires a positive integer and sets the number of repetitions
        within a batch for the Markov Chain analysis.

    -M  This requires a positive integer and sets the number of batches of
        repetitions for the Monte Carlo analysis.

    -MB This sets the number of batches of repetitions forthe Monte Carlo
        analysis.

    -MC This requires a positive integer and sets the number of repetitions
        within a batch for the Monte Carlo analysis.

INPUT FORMAT
    Your data file should contain cytonuclear counts for multi-allelic
    systems. The input file is plain text with tokens followed by
    information that the program will read. A token is any word that begins
    with a minus sign. Look at the file CNDm.dat as an example of how to
    format the file.

EXAMPLES
            % CNDm -i sample.dat   

    Will analyze the data in sample.dat. Analysis follows Asmussen and
    Basten (1994) and Basten and Asmussen (1997).

            % CNDm -i sample.dat  -rB 100 -rC 1000

    Will analyze the dat in sample.dat and do both Monte Carlo and Markov
    Chain based tests on the data (Basten and Asmussen, 1997). There will be
    a total of 100,000 repetitions in each Monte Carlo and Markov Chain
    test, divided into 100 batches of 1,000 repetitions. The program will
    calculate a p-value and standard error for that p-value for the
    hypothesis of cytonuclear equilibrium.
