NAME
    CNDd - Calculate Cytonuclear disequilibrium for diallelic systems

SYNOPSIS
    CNDd [ -i *data input* ] [ -o *data output* ] [ -e *log file* ] [ -t ] [
    -S *i*] [ -a *alpha* ] [ -b *beta* ] ...

DESCRIPTION
    CNDd calculates cytonuclear disequilibria for diallelic systems. It also
    calculates the minimum sample sizes required to detect arbitrary
    disequilibria.

OPTIONS
    -o  Use this to specify the data output file. CNDd will append to a file
        that already exists. The default value is CNDd.out.

    -i  You need to specify a data input file with this option. The default
        value is CNDd.dat. See the example files for the format.

    -e  This allows you to name a log file. The default value is CNDd.err.

    -t  Using this flag flips a switch to output data analysis in LaTeX2e
        format.

    -S  This flag requires an integer value. It is the *Sanchez* flag for
        calculating exact sample sizes. A value of zero (the default) skips
        calculating exact sample sizes. See below for more details.

    -a  Use a real value with this flag to set the type I error probability,
        otherwise known as the size or alpha, for calculating the exact
        sample sizes. The default is 0.05.

    -b  This allows you to set the type II error rate. One minus this value
        is the power. The default is 0.5.

    -pu This allows you to set an upper bound for the power when calculating
        power curves.

    -r1 Set rho1 with this option. It defaults to 0.5.

    -r2 Set rho2 with this option. It defaults to 0.5.

    -d1 Set D1 with this option and turn off usage of rho1 and rho2. It
        defaults to 0.0 which means that rho1 and rho2 are used to calculate
        D1 and D2 from the margins and a cubic equation. Note that if you
        set this option, you should know what you are doing.

    -d2 Set D2 with this option. It defaults to 0.0 and behaves like the
        previous option.

    -p1 Use this to set the marginal frequency of AA genotypes. It must be a
        probability, or it will be reset to the default value of 0.1.

    -p2 Use this to set the marginal frequency of Aa genotypes. It must be a
        probability, or it will be reset to the default value of 0.1. In
        addition, this and the previous probability must sum to a number
        less than or equal to 1.0.

    -pM Use this to set the marginal frequency of M cytotypes. It must be a
        probability, or it will be reset to the default value of 0.1.

    -Nl This allows you to set the lower bound on the sample size for use
        with the -S flag. Powers based on the exact test will be calculated
        beginning with this value, which defaults to 50. It must be a
        positive integer, or it will be reset to 50.

    -Nu This allows you to set the upper bound on the sample size for use
        with the -S flag. Powers based on the exact test will be calculated
        ending with this value, which defaults to 100. It must be an integer
        greater than the setting for the previous option (-Nl), or it will
        be rest to lower bound plus the increment.

    -Ni This allows you to set the increment on the sample size for use with
        the -S flag. Powers based on the exact test will be calculated from
        the value set with -Nl up to the value -Nu incremented with this
        value. It is 25 by default. It must be a positive integer, or it
        will be reset to 25.

    -T  Use this with care. It allows you to set the threshold for the
        probability of a margin when calculating the exact test sample size
        or power. A value of 0.0 would mean use all margins. For a value X,
        it means that margins with maximum probability less than 10E-X will
        be ignored. The default is 20, which means that margins with
        probability less than 10E-20 will be ignored. See Sanchez *et al.,*
        2004 for more details and don't use this unless you understand it.

INPUT FORMAT
    Your data file should contain cytonuclear counts for diallelic systems.
    The input file is plain text with tokens followed by information that
    the program will read. A token is any word that begins with a minus
    sign.

            -l 1
            -b
            -C    mtDNA
            -N    Mdh-2 locus
            -H    AA   Aa   aa
            -M    25    0   97
            -m    93  176    0
            -e
            -q  

    -l  is followed by the number of sets of cytonuclear genotypes.

    -C  specifies the cytoplasmic locus name.

    -N  gives the nuclear locus name.

    -H  is a header line for the allele names at the nuclear locus. Use it
        as is.

    -M  indicates that the M cytonuclear genotype counts follow in the order
        nAAM, nAaM, naaM.

    -m  indicates that the m cytonuclear genotypes counts follow in the
        order nAAm, nAam, naam.

    -p  is a flag to print out the data matrix.

    -b  marks the beginning of a set of cytonuclear genotype counts.

    -e  marks the end of a set of cytonuclear genotype counts.

    -q  tells CNDd to stop reading and start computing.

    You may repeat the block beginning with -b and ending with -e with new
    sets of counts, but be sure to update the integer value after the -l
    token, which should be the first token encountered. Note that this is a
    minus ell (not minus one), and is necessary for the program to allocate
    the proper amount of memory. If it is too small, the program will crash.

SANCHEZ FLAG
    CNDd can calculate the sample sizes required to detect the observed
    disequilibria based on asymptotic theory or the exact test. The exact
    test yields greater accuracy, but takes much more computing time. The
    *Sanchez* flag allows control of this feature. The default is a value of
    0, which means that the exact sample sizes are not calculated. Here are
    the other values:

    1.  The program will calculate the exact sample sizes required to detect
        disequilibria for the data files.

    2.  CNDd will ignore the data files and calculate a power curve for the
        margins and rho values. The sample sizes will range from the
        arguments to *-Nl* up to *-Nu* in increments of *-Ni*. You set the
        margins with the *-p1* (for *P(AA)*), *-p2* (for *P(Aa*) and *-pM*
        (for *P(M)*). The rho1 and rho2 parameters are set with *-r1* and
        *-r2*. You can also set an upper bound on the power with *-pu*.

    3.  Recalcuate Table 5 from Sanchez, *et al.,* 2004.

    4.  Calculate the exact sample size for the margins and (rho1, rho2)
        values given.

    5.  Calculate the power curve based on the asymptotic test. See item 2
        above for the parameters.

EXAMPLES
            % CNDd -i sample.dat   

    Will analyze the data in sample.dat. Analysis follows Asmussen and
    Basten (1994).

            % CNDd -i sample.dat   -S 1

    Same, except exact sample sizes are calculated for the data. You can
    also do theoretical calculations.

            % CNDd -p1 0.2 -p2 0.2 -pM 0.5 -r1 0.5 -r2 0.5 -S 4

    will calculate the exact sample size needed to detect the disequilibria
    that result when p(AA) = p(Aa) = 0.2, p(M) = 0.5, rho1 = rho2 = 0.5 and
    the size and power are 0.05 and 0.5, respectively. See Sanchez *et al.,*
    (2004) for details. For the parameter values given above, the values of
    D1 and D2 would be -0.0455 and -0.0143. Thus,

            % CNDd -p1 0.2 -p2 0.2 -pM 0.5 -d1 -0.0455 -d2 -0.0143 -S 4

    would be equivalent.

HINTS
    The exact test can take quite a bit of time. If you have data, you might
    want to run it without the exact test first. Look at the asymptotically
    derived sample sizes required to detect the observed level of
    disequilibria for DAAM, DAaM and DaaM. If the smallest one is reasonable
    (say less than 500), try rerunning with the -S 1 flag. If you have a
    Unix machine, you could compile the Unix version of this program and run
    it in the background:

            %  CNDd -i sample.dat -S 1 &

    In 2004, we generated numerical results on a Macintosh G4 Xserve running
    at 1.33 Mhz. The program code was compiled with gcc version 3.1 and
    using the -O3 flag. The time in seconds to calculate the power for a
    sample size N is approximately linear in N to the fifth power, with a
    slope of 1/10^9. A rough estimate for the time to calculate the sample
    size necessary for a specified power, would be about 5 *Na*^5/10^9,
    where *Na* is the sample size calculated via asymptotic theory (Asmussen
    and Basten, 1994), and the caret (^) means exponentiation.
